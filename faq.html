                <h2 class="question">Q1: What is LiFi, and how is it different from WiFi?</h2>
                <p class="answer">LiFi, short for Light Fidelity, is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. Unlike WiFi, which uses radio waves, LiFi transmits data through LED light bulbs, offering faster and more secure data transfer, especially in environments where security and high speed are essential.</p>

                <h2 class="question">Q2: How secure is the Optiwave LiFi system?</h2>
                <p class="answer">LiFi offers inherent security advantages since data transmission is confined to the space illuminated by the light, reducing risks of external interception. Additionally, Optiwave's systems employ encryption protocols to further protect user data.</p>
